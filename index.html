	<p align="center">This site was started 6 August 2018, a Monday. I don't 
	predict myself doing a whole lot with it,  but I wanted to see what the deal is. I'm learning 
	how to create a site with 
	<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">this 
	site</a> and with a little help from <a href="http://links.net/">links.net</a>, supposedly the 
	oldest blog on the internet.</p>
	
	<p align="center">The first thing I'm doing is organizing a file system, as I expect that if I 
	do not start out with one I will give up very easily once I realize I should have started with
	one. The file system contains at this moment three folders (titled "images," "scripts," and 
	"styles") and a document titled index.html.</p>
	
	<p align="left">The colors I am using are as follows:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>background = #545353</li>
		<li>body background = black</li>
		<li>text = white</li>
		<li>titles = #1ACB2C.</li>
		<li>border = red</li>
	</ul>
